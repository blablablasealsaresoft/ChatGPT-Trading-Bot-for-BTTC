## This is a trading script for KuCoin that continuously places buy and sell orders based on market data and a predictive model generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model.

### How it works
The script continuously streams market data from KuCoin and fetches the current ticker information for the symbol. It then calculates the midpoint between the bid and ask prices and sets the premium for the sell order. The script uses a predictive model generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to predict whether the market is going up or down. If the model predicts an upward trend, the script places a limit buy order at the midpoint price. If it predicts a downward trend, it places a limit sell order at the midpoint price. The script also checks for any open orders and updates them accordingly.
